<p>
	First of all, let me tell you English is not my first lenguage. That being
	said, I'm a happily married, 33 years old, Mechatronical Engineer, with 5
	beautiful adopted dogs (I really believe in giving more oportunity to a
	abandoned dog than buying one) <br />
	living in the suburbs and enjoying life a lot.
</p>
<br />
<p>
	Now that your know this, let me talk about the difficults that I have been
	though my life: <br />
</p>
<h3>First encounter with real life</h3>
<p>
	At the age of 21, when I was almost done with my first collage career, my
	brother got this weird illness called "Lupus" wich practicly ate up his kidney
	in less than a week <br />
	So he had to undergo through a lot of medical exams (of course we didn't know
	it was lupus at first) which made him so weak, and this got me to drop out
	from collage. <br />
	<br />
	When we realize he needed a kidney transplat, we knew that the best bet was
	me, so doctors prepared myself for over a year for what was to come ( I dont
	know if you know anything <br />
	about this, but you have to be phisically and mentally prepared to change the
	rest of your life) so, to make this short, this process took like 4 years of
	our lifes
</p>
<h3>College trouble</h3>
<p>
	So, by now, you must know that college sometimes might be a little "close
	minded", for me I found out when I tryied to comeback after all the "lupus"
	situation. <br />
	The limited information and help that my college gave me was shocking, they
	didn't wanted to revalidate my preview studies, so... I had to start over, I
	mean, I wasn´t going to quit.
</p>
<h2>Hobbies</h2>
<p>
	So lets jump to my hobbies. I actually love playing tennis(I used to be ranked
	in México when I was like 16 years old), I love running, cycling, and
	practicly all sports. <br />
	Another hobbie that y have is automating houses, I've done this in every
	single place I've lived and also in my parents house, my non technological
	brother, and a house that I have <br />
	in AirBnB, each one with a different approach.
</p>
<p>
	Programming is another of my hobbies (I actually do a lot of programming for
	smart houses) but I do challenging websites or app that I never launch, but
	just to prove myself and <br />
	the joy of it.
</p>
<p>
	So, as you can see, I could go on and on about me, but what you need to know
	is that I am really passionate about what I like and what I do.
